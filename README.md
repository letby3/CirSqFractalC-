# CirSqFractalC-
The program implements a sequential rendering of the evolution of the fractal "Square based on non-overlapping circles". In this version, it is possible to select the evolution number (up to 7).
The implementation language is "C#" without the use of complex mathematical equations. Everything was reduced to simple recursive functions with conditions.
